## Problem

### Pending Assignments

Chef has finally decided to complete all of his pending assignments.

There are $X$ assignments where each assignment takes $Y$  **minutes**  to complete.
Find whether Chef would be able to complete all the assignments in $Z$  **days**.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists three space-separated integers $X, Y,$ and $Z$ — the number of assignments, time taken in minutes to complete each assignment, and the number of days in which Chef wants to complete the assignments.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if Chef would be able to complete all the assignments in $Z$  **days**. Otherwise, print `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `YES`, `yEs`, `yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
- $1 \leq Z \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
5 5 5
50 80 2
20 72 1

```

```
YES
NO
YES
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef needs a total of $5\cdot 5 = 25$ minutes to complete all the assignments. Thus, he would be able to complete the assignments in $5$ days.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef needs a total of $50\cdot 80 = 4000$ minutes to complete all the assignments. However, in $2$ days, he only has $2\cdot 24\cdot 60 = 2880$ minutes.
Thus, he would not be able to complete the assignments in $2$ days.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef needs a total of $20\cdot 72 = 1440$ minutes to complete all the assignments. In $1$ days, he has $24\cdot 60 = 1440$ minutes.
Thus, he would be able to complete the assignments in $1$ day.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int X, Y, Z;
        cin >> X >> Y >> Z;

        int required = X * Y;
        int available = Z * 24 * 60;

        if (required <= available)
            cout << "YES\n";
        else
            cout << "NO\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Problem

### Fall Prevention

An array $A$ of length $N$ is called  *good*  if

$$ A_1 + A_2 + \ldots + A_i \ge 0 $$

for  *every*  $1 \le i \le N$.

You are given an array $A$. You may delete at most one element from the array, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Is it possible to do this such that the resulting array is  *good* ?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ — the length of the array. The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer: `Yes` if it's possible to obtain a good array after deleting at most one element, and `No` otherwise.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $2 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $-10^4 \le A_i \le 10^4$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:

Output

```
4
4
1 0 2 -1
3
1 -2 -2
5
2 -1 -2 1 0
4
0 -1 -1 3

```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  We have $A = [1, 0, 2, -1]$. The array is already  *good*  without deleting any elements, because the corresponding sums are:

- $1$
- $1+0=1$
- $1+0+2=3$
- $1+0+2+(-1) = 2$

which are all $\ge 0$.

 **Test case $2$:**  We have $A = [1, -2, -2]$.

- If we delete the $1$, the array starts with $-2$ and hence is not good.
- If we delete one of the $-2$'s, the array becomes $[1, -2]$ and $1+(-2) = -1 \lt 0$, so this isn't good either.

Thus, it's impossible to make the array  *good*  after a single deletion.

 **Test case $3$:**  We can delete $A_2 = -1$ to obtain the array $[2, -2, 1, 0]$, which can be verified to be  *good*.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector < long long > a(n), prefix(n), suffixMin(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cin >> a[i];
        prefix[0] = a[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
            prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + a[i];
        bool good = true;
        int firstBad = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            if (prefix[i] < 0) {
                good = false;
                firstBad = i;
                break;
            }
    }

    if (good) {
        cout << "YES\n";
        continue;
    }
    suffixMin[n - 1] = prefix[n - 1];
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)
        suffixMin[i] = min(prefix[i], suffixMin[i + 1]);
    bool possible = false;
    for (int i = 0; i <= firstBad; i++) {
        if (suffixMin[i] - a[i] >= 0) {
            possible = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    cout << (possible ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
return 0;
}
```

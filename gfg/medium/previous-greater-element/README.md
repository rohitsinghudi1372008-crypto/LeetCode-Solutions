# Previous Greater Element

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array  **arr[]**. For every element in the array, determine its  **Previous Greater Element (PGE)**.

The Previous Greater Element (PGE) of an element  **x**  is the first element that appears to the left of  **x**  in the array and is strictly greater than  **x**.

 **Note:**  If no such element exists, assign  **-1** as the PGE for that position.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 4, 2, 20, 40, 12, 30]
Output: [-1, 10, 4, -1, -1, 40, 40]
Explanation:
For 10, no elements on the left, so answer is -1.
For 4, previous greater element is 10.
For 2, previous greater element is 4.
For 20, no element on the left greater than 20, so answer is -1.
For 40, no element on the left greater than 40, so answer is -1.
For 12, previous greater element is 40.
For 30, previous greater element is 40.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1]
Explanation: Each element of the array has no previous greater element.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> preGreaterEle(vector<int>& arr) {
       int n=arr.size();
       vector<int> result(n,-1);
       stack<int>st;
       for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
           while(!st.empty()&&st.top()<=arr[i]){
               st.pop();
           }
           if(!st.empty()){
               result[i]=st.top();
           }
           st.push(arr[i]);
       }
       return result;
        
    }
};
```

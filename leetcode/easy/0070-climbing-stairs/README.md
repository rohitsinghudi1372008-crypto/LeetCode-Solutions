# Climbing Stairs

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 45

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int helper(int n,vector<int> &dp) {
        if(n<=2) return n;
        if(dp[n]!=-1) return dp[n];
        return dp[n]=helper(n-1,dp)+helper(n-2,dp);

    }
    int climbStairs(int n){
        vector<int >dp(n+1,-1);
        return helper(n,dp);
    }
};
```

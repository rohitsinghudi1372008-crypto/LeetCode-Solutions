# Baseball Game

## Problem

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer x. Record a new score of x.
- '+'. Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- 'D'. Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- 'C'. Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return  *the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations*.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a  **32-bit**  integer and that all operations are valid.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
"4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
"D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
"9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
"+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
"+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: ops = ["1","C"]
Output: 0
Explanation:
"1" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].
Since the record is empty, the total sum is 0.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= operations.length <= 1000
- operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or a string representing an integer in the range [-3  *104, 3*  104].
- For operation "+", there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
- For operations "C" and "D", there will always be at least one previous score on the record.

                int n = record.size();
                record.push_back(record[n - 1] + record[n - 2]);
            } 
            else if (op == "D") {
                record.push_back(2 * record.back());
            } 
            else if (op == "C") {
                record.pop_back();
            } 
            else {
                record.push_back(stoi(op));
            }
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (int x : record) {
            ans += x;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```

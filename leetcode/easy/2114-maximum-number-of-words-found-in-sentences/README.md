# Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

A  **sentence**  is a list of  **words**  that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single  **sentence**.

Return  *the  **maximum number of words**  that appear in a single sentence*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
Output: 3
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= sentences.length <= 100
- 1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100
- sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.
- sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.

    int mostWordsFound(vector<string>& sentences) {
        int ans = 0;

        for (string s : sentences) {
            int words = 1;

            for (char c : s) {
                if (c == ' ')
                    words++;
            }

            ans = max(ans, words);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
